=====================================


Why An Bitcoin Alternative?
----------------

With over 80% of Bitcoin has been mined, it is getting harder and more expensive to either mine or buy bitcoin.
Also the halving mechanism increases the market volatility and the associated risk.
This experimental initiative aims to increase total supply of the tokens and reduce the speed of halving mechanism
